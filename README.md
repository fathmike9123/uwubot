# uwubot

uwubot is a fun discord bot with the intent of making cute comments and spreading culture. The bot translates any previous comment into uwu language. It was created originally by kawaiiCirno (https://github.com/kawaiiCirno).

## Installation

Python 3 and discord.py library is required to run the discord bot.

```bash
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```

Replace the TOKEN variable in uwubot.py with your bot token.
Start the main Python script by doing:
```bash
python3 uwubot.py
```

## Commands
`!uwuhelp` - Lists all commands

`!uwu` - Uwufies the newest message in a text channel

## Deploying
In order to put this in your Discord server, you will have to run the `uwubot.py` Python script in a local machine first.
I ran this in a Raspberry Pi 4B so that it was always active.
